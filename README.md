### Project 1: Tic Tac Toe

Remember Tic Tac Toe? See [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) if you can't remember the rules, or if you haven't ever played.  It involves a couple of players, a simple board, checking for victory in a game loop... all the conditions that make it a fun little problem to solve using our newfound OOP sea legs.  Let's build it!

## Project 2: Mastermind

If you've never played Mastermind, a game where you have to guess your opponent's secret code within a certain number of turns (like hangman with colored pegs), check it out on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)">Wikipedia</a>.  Each turn you get some feedback about how good your guess was -- whether it was exactly correct or just the correct color but in the wrong space.
